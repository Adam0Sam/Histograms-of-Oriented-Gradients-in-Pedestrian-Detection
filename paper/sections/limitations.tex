\section{Limitations}

Jain et al. proposed a rough guideline of having at least 10 times as many training data points as input dimensions \cite{jain_2000_statistical}. Knowing that the largest possible dimensionality that can be obtained from the set of values in table \ref{table:dependent_variables} is 175392, as shown in figure \ref{fig:dimension_distribution}
