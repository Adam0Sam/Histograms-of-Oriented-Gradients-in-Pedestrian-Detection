\section{Limitations}

This study faced two key constraints: limited training data and computational resources. 

Following Jain et al.'s guideline \cite{jain_2000_statistical} of requiring 10x more training samples than data points to avoid the "curse of dimensionality", a dataset of $\sim$ 27,000 points proves theoretically insufficient for the feature spaces reaching up to 175,392 dimensions (most frequently 3,780 dimensions), as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:dimension_distribution}.

Computational constraints led to using SGDClassifier instead of LinearSVC for SVM training. While section \ref{sec:svm_choice} shows no significant performance difference between these approaches for specific HOG parameters, this might not hold true across all parameter sets. Additionally, the limited 5-fold cross-validation across 4 regularization parameters may have prevented finding optimal regularization values.
